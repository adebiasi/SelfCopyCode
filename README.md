# SelfCopyCode

Iteractive editor to execute code written in **BFF (Extending Brainfuck)** and to show how it generates the output. **BFF** was defined in the paper [Computational Life: How Well-formed, Self-replicating Programs Emerge from Simple Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19108) to demonstrate the emergence of __self-replicators__.

With this interactive editor it is possible to see how a __self-replicator__ works. 

This is a screenshot of the interactive editor:


This animation shows the code (i.e. __[[{.>]-] ]-]>.{[[__) that is replicating itself:
